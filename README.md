<h1>World Cup Sticker Album Tracker</h1>

<h2>Database Description:</h2>
The Panini Group comes out with Sticker Albums where you can collect football players' stickers each world cup. My friends and I were all attempting to complete this sticker album, and so I thought it would be great idea to put all stickers I had as well as any that I had doubles of in a database in order to keep track of them. 
I did this using a SQL database where I had the mother table with all the possible sticker spaces in the album and where I kept track of whether I had a sticker or not. I also made separate databases to keep more detail about each sticker. Since there are the players' stickers, the stadiums' stickers as well as some special, less common stickers at the end of the album, I made a table for each of those.

<h2>Website Description:</h2>
I also created a website using HTML as a ground to exchange stickers between users. This sticker album is something that people all over the world do, and exchanging stickers is an activity present in many countries. I designed a platform where people could not only keep track of their stickers in a more visual, and condensed way but also tell other users which stickers they had doubles of and which stickers they were willing to exchange.
